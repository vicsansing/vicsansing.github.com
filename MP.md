## Midnight's Protector 

Hello gamers, this is a page for the game Midnight's Protector, which I am designing with my friends. I will provide enemies, crafting, towns, maps, and more. This will be hopefully published or released online by 2016. It will have one main mode Quest mode. I will be getting into quests later.

I can reveal most of the architecture, so let's get into it. There will be Abandoned Huts, Dungeons, Cities, Torture Chambers, and more! So I am kind of a perfectionist so it might be a bit too nice or perty for your taste. I'm sorry. I can list five enemies for you. Ok there are Orcish Warriors, Goblins, Torturers, Vampires, and Demons. I can list one area and that is the Crotainir Republic Isle. This area will be inhabited by 15 species of animals and 3 types of metals so have fun hunting. That is another feature you may hunt animals or mine metal to your liking. There are schools in the different areas that you can get benefits from such as the Ra-Shuina Fighting School. There are also races to pick from such as the following: Rakir, Elf, Human, Scorcher, and a Druid. I will list five different metals. You can befriend an order of one type of beast such as Brears or Blackmanes after not hunting their kind or helping them find food or giving them valuables. There will be a shaman in one of the caves. Speak to him for locations. So here is the... 

### Main plot. 

You were in a fire in your farmhouse. Then suddenly you see a man. He drags you. You wake up in a new place and then ***they*** come out.

Hello once again, today is Borderlands 2 day. So Borderlands 2, like Skyrim, is big. Except you have to stick to quests ;(. There are only 5 classes to pick from but in Skyrim there are about 10 races or classes.

Pretty much what you do in this game is shoot and loot. It is an FPS, not as intense Crysis 3. But not as mellow Oddworld Strangers Wrath. I give this game a 4 for just being AWESOME! I will be doing a game a day so enjoy.

Ok, today is Skyrim day! I have to give it is huge and beautiful. Although it is great it also has some cons. Like bad glitches or cheats on a PC. I mean come on who needs 1,000,000 in the click of a button? So i give this game a 4 for being pretty, huge, for great exploration, and awesome junk!

I will be doing a game a day so enjoy.

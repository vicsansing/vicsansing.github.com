Ho-la, yet another change. This is the story of the day! So, in after-school I was told to make a penguin. I chose a toilet paper tube and other materials. His name is Mumfred. He is a British penguin. He has a small white eye and a big blue eye. He has a sun tattoo on his stomach. He is an orange belt in karate and he has a teacup handy at all times. Well, that's Mumfred for ya.

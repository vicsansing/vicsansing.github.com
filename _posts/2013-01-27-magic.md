Hello, again I'm changing things up. I shall be doing card games starting with Magic the Gathering. This is a highly collectable game! There are over ten expansions! There are five mana colors. Those being white, red, green, blue, and black. Black is usually the most gruesome. White being pretty peaceful. So I give this huge game a 5. This calls for celebration: my 1st 5!

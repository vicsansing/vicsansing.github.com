Hey, Whazz up? I am about 10 years old. I am doing this website for my dedication to Nerditude. This will hold images, reviews, and more. This will be where I have my better conversations. Don't get me wrong, I have friends but they are a little annoying. Sometimes you just need some space. So that is why I'm doing it. I will be posting videos, info, newest games, (etc.). I am a big gamer. I will write reviews and a bunch of stuff. That is what will be going on.

Adios,
Vic of the East

I'm back, people of the everywhere. Today is Lego game day so I have played Pirates of the Caribbean, all Star Wars, all Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings. These games could have better graphics but do have a bit of exploration.There are no side quests sadly. Which is frankly not cool. So I would give these small games a 3.5 for just being a mid level
game that I enjoy.

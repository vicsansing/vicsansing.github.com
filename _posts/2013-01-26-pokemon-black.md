Hey peoples, today is (drumroll) Pokemon Black day! So this game offers a variety of Pokemon and exploration. There are so many Pokemon to catch it is insane! I personally like the variety of looks and moves they have. I also like that you can have fishing poles, bikes, and much more. So I give this game a 4 for variety.

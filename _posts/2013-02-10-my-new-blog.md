So, my team and I have been working hard in free-time at school. We decided to have a blog that talks about us, [our game](http://vicsansing.github.com/MP.html), and more.
There will be at least one post a day. If you have ideas feel free to comment. Oh, and please don't troll.

### About this new blog:

Today, I have been working since 10:30 in the morning. It is now 3 o'clock. I have had a ton of fun learning about git, Jekyll, Ruby gems, Markdown, and a few other things I don't remember. Now, I have a blog and a home page! 

 再見 (goodbye).

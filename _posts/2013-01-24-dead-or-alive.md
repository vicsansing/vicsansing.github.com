Hello, it is Dead or Alive 4 day! So this game is a game with multi player and single player. It is kind of like Marvel vs. CapCom. Basically it is a big fighting game with a variety of characters. There are only 3 multiplayer arenas so it is kind of small. Overall, I give this game a 3 for variety.
